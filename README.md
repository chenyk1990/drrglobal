## NOTES:
 
1. To run the reproducible scripts (test_xxxx.m), please first download the required package from: https://github.com/chenyk1990/MATseisdl. 

2. Please put the MATseisdl package in the main directory and add its sub-directories to the Matlab toolbox path. 

3. The scripts beginning with "test_" are runnable scripts.

4. The directory [subroutines](https://github.com/chenyk1990/drrglobal/tree/main/subroutines) stores all the required subroutines. 

5. The current version is based on Matlab. Future versions may also support Python and be optimized regarding computational efficiency. 

6. All figures (except for fig1, which is a schematic plot, and fig11, which is based on Madagascar and powerpoint) in the drrglobal paper are in the following directory for a quick look (https://github.com/chenyk1990/drrglobal/tree/main/gallery/). 

7. The label fonts are different across different Matlab versions and platforms (Linux, Max). The figures presented in the paper are from Mac-Pro Matlab 2022b.

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the drrglobal package can be found at
    https://github.com/chenyk1990/gallery/tree/main/drrglobal
Each figure in the gallery directory corresponds to a test_figNO.m script in the "main" directory with the exactly the same file name (figNO.png).

These gallery figures are also presented below.
